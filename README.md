**Batted Balls in Play**



The following project looks to determine what type of out (strike out, fly out, ground out, line out) is correlated to Earned Run Average (ERA) for pitchers. The pitcher's job is to get batters out at a high rate without giving up runs. Pitchers with lower ERA's are in high demand and get paid well when they hit free agency. Does it matter how the batter gets out or is there a type of out that is best suited to keep runs off the scoreboard.



ERA is determined by the following formula: Earned Runs (ER) / Innings pitched (IP) * 9. And earned run is defined as any run that scores against a pitcher without the benefit of an error or a passed ball. Often, it is the judgment of the official scorer as to whether a specific run would've scored without the defensive mishap. Therefore runs that score with defensive mishaps will not be counted against the pitcher because he had no effect on the run scoring. 



The below scatter plot shows the relationship between the outs and pitchers' ERA. The more strikeouts a pitcher gets the lower the ERA. Seems to show that avoiding contact is the best way to lower your ERA. This would explain the increase in strike outs.
